# My WebDev journey ðŸš€

This is a private repository where I'll post all the projects that I make while learning WebDev, might range from something really small like button hover effect or complete websites so please do not judge me and also my first personal GITHub repository.

## 1. Button Hover Effect

The first file uploaded on this github and contains the hover effect I created after learning transitions.

## 2. Pricing Panel Project

Created a basic pricing menu and implemented Flexbox which is responsive

## 3.Glassmorphism

Created a basic login form in glassmorphism style.
